# Project Title: Solar Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview

This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of solar radiation data and its associated meteorological variables. The key tasks include exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and the development of an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to visualize the findings.

The repository is structured to facilitate collaborative development, CI/CD integration, and efficient Python programming practices. It provides all necessary code and documentation for reproducing and extending the analysis and dashboard.
